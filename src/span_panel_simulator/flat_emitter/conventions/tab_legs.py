"""Tab-to-leg assignment convention for US residential split-phase panels.

US residential load centers alternate breaker slots between L1 and L2: odd-numbered
tabs land on L1, even-numbered tabs land on L2. A 240 V dipole circuit occupies
two adjacent tabs (e.g. 1 and 2) — one per leg.

This module is the single source of truth for that convention. Per-leg current
calculations in ``PanelMeter`` and the per-circuit ``current_a`` derivation go
through ``legs_for_tabs`` rather than reaching for ``tab % 2`` directly.

Future support for non-US panels (European single-phase, 3-phase commercial) lands
here as an additional ``Convention`` enum + dispatch, without touching call sites."""
