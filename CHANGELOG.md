## [unreleased] — emitter live-schema alignment and abstraction (feat/emitter-integration)

### Changed

- **Emitter schema alignment**: Adapter updated to work with emitter's live SPAN panel Homie 5 schema (flat node layout, accurate topology and properties).
- **Lugs IDs**: Updated to match emitter convention (`lugs-upstream`, `lugs-downstream`).
- **BESS/PV feeds**: Updated spec_generator to derive device feeds and metadata from circuit templates (stable circuit UUID linkage).
- **Simulator adapter**: Updated `spec_generator.py` and `runtime.py` to pass EVSE powers to emitter, set `clear_retained=True` on clone stop for graceful shutdown.

### Fixed

- **Dev bootstrap dependency drift**: `scripts/dev-setup.sh` installed `ebus-emitter` with a bare `uv pip install --editable`, which re-resolves the emitter's dependency constraints against PyPI and ignores its `uv.lock`. A fresh bootstrap pulled `ebus-sdk` 0.12.0 — whose `Device` constructor is incompatible with the 0.1.x API the emitter targets — and panel startup died with `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'` in `connect_broker()`. The script now installs the emitter's locked runtime dependencies first, then the emitter itself with `--no-deps`, so the venv matches what the emitter pins.
- **Type safety**: Fixed mypy error in simulator runtime (`_first_feed_for_device_type`) where template_name could be None.
